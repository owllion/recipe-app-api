ARG DEV=false
#we're overriding this insdie the docker-compose file by sepecifing args dev equals to true
#So when we use Dockerfile through the docker-compose configuration, it's gonna update this dev variable to true. Whereas when we use it in any other Docker-compose configuration, it's gonna leave it as false,so by default we're not running in development mode.
#(所以一般情況我們都是在啥mode??)

#command that would run when we're building image
RUN python -m venv /py && \ 
#Because Each instruction creates one layer
#所以老師在這他用 &&\ 去做分隔，這樣就只會創建一個layer
#而不是用很多個RUN 去執行這邊每一行的 && \
#which can keep our image lightweight as possible.
#然後venv代表虛擬環境， 用這是因為一些image裡面的py的dependencues可能和你自己裝的會有衝突之類的
#所以總之就是prevent any conflicring dependencies
#that may come in the base image you're using.

    /py/bin/pip install --upgrade pip &&\
    #update pip(python package manager) inside our virtual env

    #安裝postgresql adaptor(為了讓django可和db連接)所需的套件!
    apk add --update --no-cache postgresql-client && \
    #It's the client package that we're gonna install inside our Alpine image in order for psycopg2 to be able to connect to Postgresql.
    #It's the dependency that needs to stay inside the Docker image when we're running in production.

    apk add --update --no-cache --virtual .tmp-build-deps \
        #It sets a virtual dependency package. It's kinda groups the packages that we install into this temp-build-deps and we can use this to remove these packages later on inside our Dockerfile.

        build-base postgresql-dev musl-dev && \
        #the package we needed in order to install our Postgres adaptor.
        #上面那一段提到的"groups the packages that we install ..."指的就是這一行安裝的套件喔!

    /py/bin/pip install -r /tmp/requirements.txt &&\
    #install the requirements inside the Docker image.
    #actually this is installed inside the virtual env
    #coz 這邊是設定 py/bin/pip(就是代表虛擬環境)

    if [ $DEV = "true" ]; \
        then /py/bin/pip install -r /tmp/requirements.dev.txt ; \
    fi && \
    #shell script, not the typo.It's the way you end the statement by writing it backwards, like 'fi'.
    #Anyway, if we build it without dev being true, the dev dependencies are ont installed on our Docker image, which saves a little bit of space and also adds a little bit of security because oyu do not need to worry about the bugs and things in the "development" dependencies if you do not install'em on your "production" image.


    rm -rf /tmp && \
    #remove the tmp directory, coz we do not want any extra dependencies on our image once it's being created. It's best practice to keep Docker images as lightweight as possible.
    #So it there's any file tiy do not need on the actual image, make sure to remove them as part of your build process.
    #(So ant file you just need temporarily, you add it, use it inside the Dockerfile and then remove it before the end of the Dockerfile.)
    #This can save a lot of space and speed when you're deploying your app.

    apk del .tmp-build-deps && \
    #這邊就是刪除用不到的套件

    adduser \ 
    #add new user inside our image. Coz it's best practice not to user the root user.
    #If we did not specify this,the only user available inside the alpine image that we're using would be the root user(has the full acces and premissons to do everything on the sercer).
    #Just do not user root user, coz if your app gets compromised, the attacker may have full access to everything on that Docker container.
    #But if you do not use root user,the attacker can only do what limited user can do.
        --disabled-password \
        #uesr do not need to log in with password, just by default
        --no-create-home \
        #do not want to create home directory
        django-user
        #call the user using this container 'django user', you can call it whatever you want.

ENV PATH="/py/bin:$PATH"
#update the  environment variable inside the image and we're updating the path env variable
#And 'path' is the env variable that's automatically created on Linux OS, what is does it's define all of the directory where all the executables(?) can be run.
#And what we do here is because we run the command on the virtual environment, we do not want to specify /py/bin everytime, so we specify this variable here, that way, whenever we run any py commands it will run automatically from our vitual environment. 

USER django-user
#until run this line ,everything else is being done as the root user,but we will run using the last user the image switched to,which is django user.
